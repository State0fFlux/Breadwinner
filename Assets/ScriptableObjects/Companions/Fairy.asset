  name: Honeybell
  tagline: Give me a tagline!
  biography: "With just a sweep of her hand, Honeybell is able to conjure tiny golden
    sparks that fill Crust\u2019s Bakery with warmth. These sparks seem to be alive,
    fluttering and thriving long after she\u2019s gone. When they\u2019re not filling
    the bakery, these sparks seem to reside in her long, glistening hair giving it
    a soft, gentle glow.\n\nHoneybell adores sweets, especially custard tarts topped
    with fruit, and can often be caught sneaking one (or four) when she thinks nobody\u2019s
    looking. She swears that her lights shine brighter after a sugar boost. Whether
    that\u2019s true or not, nobody\u2019s brave enough to argue with her when it
    comes to her sweets. "
