  tagline: Give me a tagline!
  biography: "Ever since Crust\u2019s Bakery first opened its doors, something\u2019s
    been\u2026 off. Ingredients would be moved, windows would creak open and trails
    of salt appeared in the strangest places. That\u2019s Brine: an earnest ghost
    who decided that it was their duty to haunt the bakery with all the ghosty-ness
    they could muster. Unfortunately, they quickly discovered that\u2026 they\u2019re
    not very good at it. Whenever Crust comes to investigate Brine\u2019s shenanigans,
    they\u2019d panic and hide under the shelves until the coast was clear.\n\nStill,
    they haven\u2019t given up. Every morning, Brine coats themselves in a light
    dusting of salt to give their ghostly form more shape. It\u2019s said to sparkle
    like frost when the light hits it right. The marigold resting on Brine\u2019s
    head never seems to wilt. Nobody knows why, but it always seems to stand taller
    whenever Brine would nudge a bag of sugar towards Crust rather than making it
    vanish altogether. It turns out, helping may be far more fulfilling to Brine
    than haunting ever was."
