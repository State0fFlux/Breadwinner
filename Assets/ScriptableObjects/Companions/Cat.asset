  name: Puff
  tagline: "<b>\u201CWHO DARES TO DISTURB THE GREAT AND POWERFUL PUFF\u2019S BEAUTY
    SLUMBER!\"</b>"
  biography: "Nobody knows what color Puff\u2019s fur really is anymore. Not even
    Puff himself. He\u2019s spent so much time napping in flour bags by the bakery
    windows, that he\u2019s become permanently dusted white. He claims it\u2019s
    for the warmth, but everyone knows that he can\u2019t resist the smell of freshly
    baked goods. That evil, traitorous smell that calls his name.\n\nDespite being
    gluten intolerant, he can\u2019t resist a good loaf, which results in an hour
    of agonized mewing and regrets. Perhaps that\u2019s why he always looks so cross.
    Legend has it that he\u2019s only smiled twice in his life; though he\u2019ll
    deny it."
